drinktrade.com joshua weissman get your got dang coffee on and let's talk about this recipe paella like i said it's a beautiful vehicle that can go any direction you want what i would recommend is that you first start with this recipe play around with it and realize how many different directions you can take it's unlimited so with all that being said let's make this shall we paella can be very versatile so consider this your gateway into the world of big round rice plates that can feed a whole got-dang village plus it's basically a one-pot meal before we start we need a shrimp stock thankfully this recipe uses one pound or 450 grams of shrimp that's been peeled and deveined but please get shrimp with the peels on so you can peel them yourself and then reserve all of those shells place them in a medium-sized sauce pot along with one rough chopped onion and four to five bay leaves cover that with four and a half cups or one liter of water place on the stove and bring to a boil over medium-high heat and then immediately reduce the temperature to medium-low and simmer that for to 20 minutes or until flavored to your liking strain it through fine mesh sieve and you have a beautiful shrimp stock now the rest of this is actually fairly quick and easy and done in a single pan did somebody see one pot meal oh my god somebody call them moms you're gonna need a 15-inch paella pan or saute pan i'm a big fan of this one so the link for that will be in the description before you start prepare your lobbies by taking two lobster tails cutting along the center top of the lobster then cutting each of the ribbings on the underside in the same path as the top gently split the top open so it exposes the meat remove the vein that runs along the center if it's still there then take your knife slice straight down the middle and press aggressively on the back of your knife to split the lobster cleanly in half now please when you're doing this keep your fingers free from the blade alright that seems basic but it's just a reminder safety first for the love of your fingies now just repeat with the other tail now in a separate pot grease with spray oil and add half a pound or 227 grams of boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into half-inch cubes steer those for about three minutes tossing occasionally until you get some nice color no need to cook it all the way through at this stage remove all of your chicken and add a mixture of two and a half cups or 600 milliliters of chicken stock and three cups or 700 milliliters of shrimp stock heat to medium high till comes to a boil and turn it to low and then just add about one teaspoon or just under a gram of saffron threads lightly crushed keep it on low heat so it's hot i guess it's sort of a two-part meal at this point now it is time paella has some rules so listen carefully one you must use bomba or some other spanish short grain rice but i'm using bomba here two this is the polar opposite of most ways we cook rice and is done with no lid or washing and in an open pan i know i know seems wrong this is how it's done and three do not stir what do you make in risotto relax now in a 15 inch paella pan or saute pan heat 2 tablespoons or 23 grams of extra virgin olive oil over medium heat once it begins to shimmer add 5 ounces or 140 grams of finely cube spanish chorizo that's spanish chorizo spanish chorizo is not the same as mexican chorizo now cook that stirring occasionally for one to two minutes or until the chorizo begins to get a little crispy and is rendered most of its fat and next you'll add your sofrito consisting of a mixture of one yellow onion very finely chopped one red bell pepper also finely chopped and five cloves of garlic finely chopped all tossed together and then placed into your pan season that generously with salt and pepper and saute for three to four minutes or until softened then add one cup or 245 grams of canned diced tomatoes and one bay leaf and two and a half teaspoons or seven grams of smoked paprika season a taste of salt and cook that down stirring often until most of the liquid is gone about three minutes then add one cup or 240 milliliters of dry white wine again let that simmer down until the majority of your wine has been reduced out about five to eight minutes now finally add your chicken back stir together until the chicken is hot then add three cups or 570 grams of bomba rice stir together allowing the rice to toast for about one minute then slowly pour in your hot saffron broth all evenly around your paella pan gently shake the pan to even out the rice let that come to a simmer over medium-low and cook uncovered for 15 minutes now if a lot of the liquid is evaporated and it's not really starting to soften yet then you can add another cup or so of water around the pan and simmer for a grand total of 15 to 18 minutes another thing that makes paella special is this moment add in your seafood first this begins with your split lobster tail arranging them in a pattern like this and nestling them into your rice flush side down then nestle your shrimps nicely all around the rice and finally nestle in one pound of cleaned little neck clams i do actually like to stand my shrimp up like this yes they look like they're dancing oh haha but also makes them cook more evenly sipping that for another five to eight more minutes and once it looks like there isn't any more liquid bubbling and it starts to smell a little toasted on the bottom of the pan that's great to finish this you'll cut the heat and immediately cover it tightly with foil to steam cook this for another 10 to 12 more minutes now if for some reason the lobster still hasn't finished cooking you can always keep the foil on and pop it in a 350 oven for about five to eight more minutes and that should do it then just pull out your beautiful shimmering pan looking like a swirling vortex into an oceanic world immediately hit that with some high quality extra virgin olive oil ideally spanish which would make sense here scatter around some lemon cheeks just barely cut on the outside of the core of a lemon to avoid the seeds to get a pure juicy flesh finish that with some fresh flat leaf parsley you know making a little garden with happy thoughts and right there is a stunning centerpiece to your table kiss two horses on their ears and call back home but wait before we get too happy about this the bottom of the paella is just as important as the top if you did this correctly then the underside of the piyo will be heavily caramelized and chock full of crispy rice this is called sokarat and hopefully the spanish homies will give papa a little kiss for this one now let's see if this party of a rice dish reigns supreme over the world of rice recipes good lord traditionally would be served right in front of you you got your little bowl or plate get yourself some stuff boop bop and you just keep going but let me just point something out we secured the soaker up sakura i'm not the greatest with the pronunciation thing but i got the crisp that's all i got to say so you can't say that this isn't paella good god so first it's almost like a sandwich you have two layers caramelized rice at the top soft pillowy rice in the middle and crisp rice at the bottom you can taste the fragrance of the saffron and then of course perfectly cooked seafood and if that is not enough for you hit it with a little bit of lemon to freshen it yeah there's a lot of ingredients yeah it takes a little bit of time but everything is done in one pan this is unintentionally a one pot meal but what more could you possibly want that's what it is you wanna know what else has a big shining bountiful platter full of everything that the ocean has to offer b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it just a quick massive thank you to our sponsor for the day trade coffee we appreciate you we love you don't forget to click that link in the description to get your first three bags 20 off and enjoy your perfectly matched cup of coffee it's a great time to be drinking coffee so paella that is one hell of a plate of food the beauty of this dish isn't just the variety i know that's was my whole selling point before but what i personally like about it is it looks so beautiful when presented on the table in front of your guests or you got friends and family or maybe it's just you and a loved one or maybe you're by yourself which is even better because then you can just eat straight out of the plate it's actually quite simple to prepare but it looks so stunning once it's done you don't care about that well then i can't help you i don't know what to say that's the whole purpose of the dish you don't want to make it i'm not going to try and
